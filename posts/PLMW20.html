<p>At the <a href="https://popl20.sigplan.org/home/PLMW-POPL-2020" target="_blank">Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop</a>
    at <a href="https://popl20.sigplan.org/" target="_blank">POPL 2020</a> in New Orleans,
    Louisiana, I gave the second iteration of my talk about mental health in
    academia.<!--more--> (The <a href="/PLMW19" target="_blank">first version of the talk</a> was at SPLASH 2019 last
    October.)
</p>

<p><!-- Here's the video: --> The video is yet to be published, but will appear here
    when it is up! For now, here are the slides:</p>

<p>I believe this topic is deeply important, and spoken of far too little in our world.
    As I say in the talk, I want to be a resource: if you ever want someone to talk to,
    you can always <a href="mailto:kwf@very.science">send me an email</a> and I'll listen.</p>
